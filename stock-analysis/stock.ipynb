      "Content: We all know how the markets started this year by falling into correction territory. Electric Vehicle (EV) stocks were no exception, although there was no clear trend in the segment. Major EVs have fallen between 5% and 50% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500’s 6% drop.\n",
      "Inflation is a key to understanding that performance. EVs will require new factory processes in their manufacture, and new sets of raw materials – and those raw materials don’t come cheap. A combination of increasing demand, production bottlenecks, and a snarled distribution chain have pushed up prices for lithium, nickel, and cobalt, vital battery metals, anywhere from 16% to 70%. And in addition to metals, auto companies are finding it difficult to procure everything from semiconductor chips to window glass to flooring carpets. The result is a surge in EV prices, which on average now run some $10,000 per unit higher than combustion vehicles.\n",
      "But this isn’t the only chapter in the story. EVs are also showing rapid technological improvements, with battery efficiency and vehicle range closing in on gasoline vehicle averages, and charging infrastructure expanding its footprint and adding newer ‘fast charging’ stations. We don’t know what the final look of the EV market will be; it’s clearly still evolving, and we’re in the early stages of the shift – but the consensus among the sector experts is, the future is electric.\n",
      "And that’s the underlying fact which will provide support for EV stocks. If there’s a demand for the product, then that demand will get filled – and that will open up opportunities for investors. To get a picture of those opportunities, as they now stand, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three EV stocks that give investors a chance to ‘buy the dip,’ at least according to the analyst community.\n",
      "Lion Electric Company (LEV)\n",
      "We’ll start with a Canadian company, Quebec-based Lion Electric. This automaker focuses on some specific niches – fully electric school busses, urban transit busses, and commercial trucks. The company is one of North America’s largest EV manufacturers, and in addition to its line of 7 vehicles, Lion offers customers additional services such as parts & services, charging infrastructure, and financing. The company bills its vehicles – especially the flagship school busses – as turnkey solutions, and includes technician and driver training in the package. Lion boasts that all of its vehicles, of which some 550 are currently on the road, are zero-emission.\n",
